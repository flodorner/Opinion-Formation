# Code Folder 

Your code goes here. You could also replace the content of this file with something more meaningful


# Requirements
software: python3, gephi for some visualisations
python modules: numpy, networkx, matplotlib
probably already installed modules: random, collections, pickle
install modules for example with command: $ pip3 install numpy


# Usage
## General
to run a python file, open a terminal/shell and type for example

`...code/$ python3 experiments_holme2006.py`

most scripts and experiments generate files in the folder they are called in, we recommend calling it from a seperate folder, for example `/figures` type (on linux, windows should be similar)

```
/code $ mkdir figures
/code $ cd figures
code/figures $ python3 ../experiments_holme2006.py 
```

Files with prefix `script_` will run directly, while for `exp_` you need to go to the end of the file and uncomment the experiment function you want, then run.

## Code structure
The different models are defined as subclasses in `model.py`. Different experiments with different models and parameters are then defined in `script_` and `exp_`, which directly include the visualizations. 


## Reproducing figures from the report
### General
Many calculations take a very long time which is why for some experiments we also provide parameters that yield faster but less accurate results.
### Doing your own experiments
A good starting point (minimal setup) can be found in `exp_WBT3D_and_General.py -> WBT_evolution() `. To use additional calculations on the model (metrics), varying arguments etc., take a look at `exp_bots_short_runtime.py -> experiment_loop()` which is more complicated but very flexible. Many parameters are explained in the core module `model.py` containing the classes.

### Section 6.1 - Holme 2006

Plot from saved results: 
* 4: histograms -> `results_holme/plot_subresults_comm_size.py `.
* 5: Size of largest community ->  `results_holme/plot_subresults_max_S.py`

Plot directly from simulation (reduced size): `exp_holme2006.py -> def ...testrun() `(see comments)

### Section 6.2 - SchweighÃ¶fer 2020
* 6: gephi graph visualization tool needed. gefx files generated with `exp_gephi_network_evo.py`
* 7: evolution of opinions in 3D --> `exp_WBT3D_and_General.py -> WBT_evolution` or in old code
* 8: variation of hyperpolarization for e,N,z, S(n_dimensions) -> `exp_old_WBT_model.py`


### Section 6.3 - Generalized WBT
* 9: gephi graph visualization tool needed. gefx files generated with `exp_gephi_network_evo.py`
* 10: contour WBT `script_WBT_contour`
* 11, 12: exp wbt3d and general ->  plot_generalized_graph. (gefx files)
* 13: exp wbt3d and general -> general_evolution
 

### Section 6.4
* If y-axis is Hyperpolarization H(O) or "Maximal absolute mean opinion", figures can be reproduced in experiments_bots_original.py or if you dont want to wait for 3 days in --> `exp_bots_short_runtime.py` (see end of file for figure numbers)
* 20, A.29: $\phi,\varepsilon$ and bots contour plots --> `script_WBT_contour_bots.py`
* 22: network visualizations of different networks and bots (+presentation gifs) --> `script_bots_visualization.py`


# Git remarks, individual contributions
Because David renamed many files in the end, the git history for these is not visible. It therefore seems that David created all the files, which is not the case and can be seen if one browses through earlier commits.
