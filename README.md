## General Introduction

Political polarization in democratic societies has reached a point, where it poses a threat to political stability. The (re-)emergence of poulism in certain countries in Europe and in the US has led to diveded societies with strongly opposing opinions. We are interested to study how opinion polarization is generated. In adddtion, we are interested to see how artificial actors, so-called bots, have an impact on opinion polarization as in the past there have been made claims that bots have tried to influence recent presidential election campaigns. There are many opinion and polarization dynamics model that try to simulate how opinions are formed and how polarization can result form this.
Holme & Newman (2006) developed a opinion dynamics model that lets networks and opinions simultaneously influence each other. On the other hand, Schweighofer et al. (2020) devoloped a multiopinion dynamics model that can generate polarization, but does not account for the influence of network structures. Therefore, we want to study what effects network structures have on polarization dynamics. In addition, we are interested to see what effects the introduction of bots can have on a multidimensional opinion dynamics model that can generate polarization and acocunts for complex network structures.

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

> * How does the introdcution of a complex network influence the polarization dynamics model developed by Schweighofer et a. (2020)?
> * How do bots influence this model?

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
  
We intend to use the Agent-Based Models of opinion and polarization dynamics developed by Holme & Newman (2006) and Schweighofer et a. (2020) as base models. We first implement these two models in Python using our own code, i.e. how we think that the model could be implemented and not look how the authors implemented them. This followed by proposing a set of extensions that allows us to combine these two models to a "generalized" model in order to study the effects of network strucutres on polarization dynamics. We also plan to introduce bots to this "generalized" model to see how this changes the opinion and polarization dynamics.
